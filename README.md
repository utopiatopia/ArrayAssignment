# ArrayAssignment
This is an assignment for my AP Computer Science A class. I don't know what you can really get from this.

Note, the instructions are implicitly stating to store data in multiple different classes. Furthermore, spoken directions state that I'm not allowed to use any arrays above one dimension.

## Instructions
### Orginal Array

- Names must be uppercase
- URL must be lowercase
- State must be reversed

### Arrays
- Name
- URL
- State
- "bigBoy"

## Programming
- If a state has more than forty colleges, make the school name lowercase and reverse the state name.
- If the character count of school name times one-hundred thousand is greater than or equal to max the integer size, copy the school to the bigBoy array.
- If the amount of colleges in one state count is greater than forty-two multiply each school's character count by ten million and if that is greater than or equal to the max integer size, copy the school to the bigBoy array.
- List the schools in alphabetical order.
- Restore to the original array.
